### Frontend SDK

The Nocturne Frontend SDK is a thin wrapper library that enables app frontends to

1. Read users private asset balances from Nocturne-supporting wallets.

2. Send user operations to wallets for authorization and proof generation.

### Wallet SDK

The Nocturne Wallet SDK contains all required components to maintain private user states. It contains logic for

- Note parsing and management
- Operation generation
- Operation signing
- Proof generation for JoinSplits in an operation
- Reading from and writing to Nocturne bundlers via JSON-RPC
