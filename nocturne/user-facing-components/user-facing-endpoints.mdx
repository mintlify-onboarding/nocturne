### **Nocturne Snap**

The Nocturne MetaMask Snap is the first official Nocturne wallet client. It is automatically installed to a user's MetaMask extension wallet when the user first interacts with a Nocturne-supporting application. The Nocturne Snap uses the Nocturne Wallet SDK under the hood and utilizes BIP-44 to derive key material from the user's MetaMask seed phrase.

### Other Nocturne-Supporting Wallets

While the first wallet client will be MetaMask Snap, Nocturne is an open ecosystem and hopefully, a future standard for integrating privacy into wallets. As such, we expect to diversify the wallet client offerings over time.

### Nocturne-Supporting App Frontends

EVM applications need only to integrate with the frontend SDK to support anonymous usage of their application. At first, we will maintain Nocturne-supporting frontends for popular dapps. Over time, we expect to partner with applications to extend their offerings to Nocturne users.
