To protect our users and build a lasting solution, we filter out high-risk deposits and use rate limits. There is no custody riskâ€”once funds are deposited, the protocol is permissionless. At no point in the process do depositors divulge any additional information beyond what already exists on-chain.

**Deposit Filtering:** Using public on-chain metadata and known address blacklists, we filter out deposit attempts from high-risk addresses.

**Per-Address Rate Limits:** Each address will have a default rate limit for how much it can deposit each day.

**Global Rate Limits:** The protocol will have a daily global rate limit for deposits across all address. Combined, the global and per-address rate limits create high friction for illicit actors like protocol hackers.
