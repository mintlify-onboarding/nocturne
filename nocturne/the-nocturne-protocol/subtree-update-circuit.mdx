## Mechanism
Our biggest gas bottleneck used to be Poseidon hashes for inserting new note commitments into the commitment tree. It cost us around 1.3M gas to insert a single note.

To avoid this, we employ a technique that we call "subtree updates" to update the [commitment tree](/nocturne/the-nocturne-protocol/notes-nullifiers-and-joinsplits) in batches without performing any Poseidon hashes on-chain.

There are two cases for an insertion:

1. We're inserting a Note that was constructed on-chain. This is the case for refunds and deposits. In this case, we'd have to compute the note commitment first, and then insert the note
2. We're inserting a note commitment directly. This is the case for the output notes for JoinSplits, whose contents are never revealed on-chain.

To implement subtree updates, we wrote a library called OffchainMerkleTree. The OffchainMerkleTree has the following state variables:

1. `root`: the current root of the Merkle tree
2. `count`: the number of leaves in the tree. This does not include leaves that are queued but have yet to be inserted.
3. `batch`: a `uint256` array of size `B`, where `B` is the batch size, chosen upon instantiation. We use a batch size of 16. This array is used to track a batch of insertion digests, which we will define below.
4. `batchLen`: a length counter used to indicate how many new _insertion digests_ are queued up in `batch`. 
5. `accumulatorQueue`: a queue of accumulator hashes, which we will define below.

Whenever an insertion needs to take place, instead of performing it immediately, we will compute the **_insertion digest_**, which is defined as follows:

1. If we're inserting a `note`, the insertion digest is `sha256(note)`.
2. If we're inserting a `noteCommitment`, the insertion digest is simply the note commitment

Then, we will "push" the insertion digest into batch and increment `batchLen`. 

When batch is full (i.e. `batchLen = B`), then we compute the batch's `accumulatorHash`, which is defined as `sha256(batch)` and enqueue it into `accumulatorQueue`.

> If we force `B` to be a power of two, then every batch will fall on a subtree of the commitment tree, making the batch insertion logic delightfully simple. This is also why we call it a "subtree update"

This is all more or less a fancy way to "queue" up batches of insertions in a manner such that we can avoid needing to store all of the individual insertions on-chain.

Next, we introduce an off-chain actor called the subtree updater. Anyone can run a subtree updater, and it plays the following role:

1. Constantly observe new insertions as they are enqueued on-chain.
2. Whenever a batch is filled, pull that batch's accumulatorHash from the chain and apply the batch to a local copy of the tree.
3. generate a ZKP that proves the following statement: if one were to apply the batch whose hash is `accumulatorHash` to a local copy of the tree with root `root`, the new root would be `newRoot`.
4. submit that to the chain by calling a method `subtreeUpdate(proof, newRoot)`
5. `subtreeUpdate` will verify the proof against the current `root` and the tip of the `accumulatorQueue`.
6. If the verifier accepts, `subtreeUpdate` can conclude that `newRoot` is correct, and it will 
    1. dequeue from `accumulatorQueue`
    2. set `root` to `newRoot`
7. If the verifier does not accept, `subtreeUpdate` will revert.

In this scheme, never have to do any Poseidon hashing on-chain. While sha256 in-circuit is too expensive for a client, the Subtree Updater role can be carried out by a powerful-ish server - as long as someone is updating the tree, then the system will continue processing transactions.

> In practice, the subtree update prover isn't that expensive. It only takes ~6s with rapidsnark on an Ubuntu desktop with an 16-core AMD Ryzen 9 5950X and 64GB of RAM.

The gas cost per insertion is now the cost to verify the subtree update proof split B ways, plus the gas cost of a few more (warm) storage reads/writes for the batch array and `accumulatorQueue`.

## Encodings

The subtree update circuit uses EncodedNote as defined in the [JoinSplit Circuit](/nocturne/the-nocturne-protocol/joinsplit-circuit).

The only other special encoding we need for this circuit is to deal with the fact that accumulatorHash is a 256-bit value, which is not guaranteed to fit in an Fp element. 

Another public input for the circuit is the path to the root of the subtree spanning our batch update. The way this is encoded requires a bit more detail about the commitment tree's structure.

Our note commitment tree is quaternary - each branch node has four children, not two. That means the "path" is not a sequence of booleans (left vs right), but a sequence of numbers between 0 and 4. For binary trees, usually people use the fact that the big-endian binary representation of the index of a given leaf is the path - starting at the root, each bit when read left-to-right tells us which way to go.  This would be a `D - log2(B)` bit unsigned integer, where `D` is the depth of the tree and B is the batch size.

For our quaternary tree, this is almost identical - the only difference is that we read the big-endian bit representation of the index two bits at a time, giving us a sequence of two-bit numbers 0-4 which tell us which child to traverse instead of a sequence of bits. If our tree is depth `D` then this will be a `2*D - log2(B)` bit number. In our case, `D = 16` and `B = 16,` which means our path will take up 28 bits.

This gives us plenty of room so we can pack the 3 most-significant bits of `accumulatorHash` into the path's field element. The resulting encoding is as follows:

1. `accumulatorHash` is the Fp element represented by the 253 least-significant bits of the "actual" 256-bit `accumulatorHash`
2. `encodedPathAndHash` is the Fp element represented by the following bits, from most-significant to least-significant:
    1. `254 - (2*D - log2(B)) - 3` `0` bits
    2. the 3 most-significant bits of the actual `accumulatorHash`
    3. the `2*D - log2(B)` bits of the path from the root of the commitment tree to the root of the subtree spanning the batch insertion

## Statement to Prove

The Subtree Update circuit has the following public inputs:

1. `accumulatorHash` - the 253 least-significant bits of the hash at the tip of the accumulatorQueue on-chain
2. `encodedPathAndHash` - a bit-packed field element containing the path from the root of the commitment tree to the root of the subtree spanning the batch and the 3 most-significant bits of `accumulatorHash`.
    - For notation's sake, I will use `encodedPathAndHash.hashBits` to refer to the 3 hash bits, and `encodedPathAndHash.path` to refer to the `2*D - log2(B)` path bits
3. `oldRoot` - the old root of the commitment tree
4. `newRoot` - the claimed new root of the commitment tree

We also define the constant `EMPTY_SUBTREE_ROOT`, which is the root of the depth-`log2(B)` subtree containing `B` zeros.

And requires the following private data:

1. `SubtreeMembershipProof` - a depth` 2*D - log2(B)`-bit Merkle membership proof against `newRoot` whose claimed leaf is the root of the subtree
2. EmptySubtreeMembershipProof - a depth `2*D - log2(B)`-bit Merkle membership proof against `oldRoot` whose claimed `leaf` is `EMPTY_SUBTREE_ROOT`.
3. `notes` - a size `B` array `EncodedNote` for each leaf in the tree. For note commitment insertions, the corresponding entry is ignored.
4. `leaves` - a size `B` array containing the leaves of the subtree - that is, the note commitments of every note to be inserted, no matter which insertion case it is.
5. `bitmap` - `B` bits indicating which insertions are note insertions and which insertions are note commitment insertions. If `bitmap[i] == 1`, then the ith insertion should be treated as a `note` insertion, not a note commitment insertion.
6. `preimage` - a size `B*256` bit array containing every insertion digest concatenated together.

We prove that the following conditions hold true, converting to/from big-endian bit representation as needed:

1. for the `i`th `bit` of `bitmap`:
    1. `bit` is `0` or `1`
    2. if `bit == 1`, then
        1. `preimage[i*256..(i+1)*256] = sha256(notes[i])`
        2. `leaves[i] = noteCommit(note)`, where `noteCommit` computes the note commitment of a note.
    3. otherwise, `preimage[i*256 + 2..(i+1)*256] = leaves[i]`
2. `encodedPathAndHash.hashBits || accumulatorHash = sha256(preimage)`
3. `SubtreeMembershipProof.leaf` is the root of the depth-`log4(B)` subtree whose leaves are `leaves`.
4. `EmptySubtreeMembershipProof.leaf` is the root of an empty depth-`log4(B)` subtree.
5. `EmptySubtreeMembershipProof.path` represents the same path as `encodedPathAndHash.path`
6. `SubtreeMembershipProof.path` represents the same path as `encodedPathAndHash.path`
7. `EmptySubtreeMembershipProof` is a valid Merkle membership proof against `oldRoot`. This asserts that the subtree was empty before the insertion.
8. `SubtreeMembershipProof` is a valid Merkle membership proof against `newRoot`. This asserts that newRoot is the correct root resulting from the subtree update.
