### Cryptography and Zero-Knowledge Circuits

Nocturne cryptography and zero-knowledge circuits are designed with two overarching criteria:

* Optimize for minimal end-user friction by minimizing proof generation delay and on-chain proof verification overhead.

* Use battle-tested cryptography and tooling when possible.

For our V1 design, we utilize:

1. 1.  
Circom and SnarkJS for working with zero-knowledge circuits. The underlying proof system is Groth16.

2. 2.  
The Poseidon hash function as a hash function that's efficient in-circuit.

3. 3.  
The Baby Jubjub curve as an elliptic curve that's efficient in-circuit.

4. 4.  
Schnorr signatures as the primary authentication scheme

5. 5.  
A novel yet simple one-time anonymous address scheme

6. 6.  
A shielded pool design that iterates on Zcash Sapling, Aztec Connect, Semaphore, and Flax.

7. 7.  
Batch verification for Groth16 proofs to reduce on-chain verification cost.

8. 8.  
Batch ZK merkle tree updates to eliminate the need to compute Poseidon hashes on-chain.

Our design yields the following preliminary performance numbers:

* Due to our gas optimizations (point 6 and 7 above), on-chain gas overhead of an operation is typically only 200-250k, depending on the number and amount of assets spent and received. In contrast, Tornado Cash required more than 1 million gas for deposits.

* The transaction circuit can be proved in under 2 seconds in a browser. Due to our "zk" subtree update mechanism, there is an additional \~6 seconds latency between transaction settlement and asset availability (e.g. output of a swap operation cannot be used in another swap until after this delay).

This section contains detailed specifications for all of nocturne's cryptography and circuits. Be warned - it contains math, and it assumes some background knowledge in cryptography.
