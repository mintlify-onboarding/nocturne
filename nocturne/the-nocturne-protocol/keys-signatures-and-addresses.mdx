## Algebraic Primitives

Unless otherwise specified, all values are assumed to be elements of the Scalar field of BN254 as defined in [EIP-197](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-197). We will refer to this field as the "BN254 Scalar field" or <Latex>Fp​</Latex> for short. We will use <Latex>p</Latex> to refer to the order of the BN254 scalar field.

For all elliptic curve cryptography, including our addressing and signature schemes, we use the Baby Jubjub curve, the curve whose base field is <Latex>Fp​</Latex> as defined in [EIP-2494](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2494). All operations are performed in Baby Jubjub's prime-order subgroup, which we will refer to as "Baby Jubjub", or <Latex>G</Latex> (blackboard "G" as opposed to regular "G") for short.

We will use <Latex>r</Latex> to refer to the order of Baby Jubjub's scalar field (again, the prime-order subgroup, not the curve group), and we will refer that scalar field as "Baby Jubjub Scalar field", or <Latex>Fr​</Latex> for short.

We will use additive notation. More specifically we use...

- "+" to denote curve addition or field addition depending on whether we are adding curve elements or field elements
- "•" or juxtaposition to denote field multiplication
- "✕" to denote scalar multiplication, in order to clearly distinguish it from field multiplication

Furthermore, we will use all-capital letters for curve elements and all-lowercase lettrs for field elements.

## Hashing

We use the Poseidon hash function defined over the <Latex>Fp​</Latex>, the BN254 scalar field, instantiated using the [parameters set in `circomlib`'s implementation](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib/blob/master/circuits/poseidon_constants.circom). We will denote this function <Latex>H</Latex>.

## Key Derivation

The user's [spending key](/nocturne-the-nocturne-protocol/keys-and-stealth-addresses), which we will refer to as <Latex>sk</Latex>, is a secure-random element of <Latex>Fr​</Latex>.

> In Nocturne's MetaMask Snap, we derive the using the `snap_getBip44Entropy` method at derivation path `m / 44' / 6789'`.

Let <Latex>G</Latex> denote the generator of Baby Jubjub. The user's spending public key, which we will refer to as <Latex>PK</Latex>, is an element of Baby Jubjub defined as <Latex>PK = sk X G</Latex>. This is only used in the context of signatures to be verified in-circuit. It never appears on-chain or leaves the client.

The user's [viewing key](/nocturne-the-nocturne-protocol/keys-and-stealth-addresses) is an element of <Latex>Fr​</Latex> defined as <Latex>vk=H(PK.X ∣∣ PK.Y ∣∣ vkNonce)</Latex>, where <Latex>PK.X,PK.Y∈Fp​</Latex> are the x and y coordinates of <Latex>PK</Latex> respectively, <Latex>vkNonce∈Fp​</Latex>, and vkNonce must be chosen such that the output of the hash is an element of <Latex>Fr​</Latex>

That last provision is needed because <Latex>H</Latex> returns an element of <Latex>Fp​</Latex>, but we need an element of <Latex>Fr​</Latex>. A reduction modulo <Latex>r</Latex> would bias the key generation, and using Poseidon over <Latex>Fr​</Latex> would be prohibitively expensive in-circuit. But this approach suffers from neither issue - during key generation, we can increment vkNonce and try again if the output of the hash is not an element of <Latex>Fr​</Latex>.

> In theory, rejection sampling like this does come at a small performance cost. ~91% of the possible <Latex>vkNonce>r</Latex>, so we expect that, on average, it will take 10-11 tries to find a "good" nonce. In practice, the cost is negligible - 11 attempts takes ~30ms with a very naive implementation.

## Addresses

A user's [canonical address](/nocturne/the-nocturne-protocol/keys-and-stealth-addresses), which we will refer to as "the user's canonical address", or <Latex>C</Latex> for short, is a Baby Jubjub curve element defined as <Latex>C=vk×G</Latex>.

A user's [stealth address](<(/nocturne/the-nocturne-protocol/keys-and-stealth-addresses)>) is any pair of Baby Jubjub points <Latex>(H1​,H2​)∈G2</Latex> such that <Latex>vk×H1​=H2​</Latex>. There are many stealth addresses for any given user. Without any other information, the association between any two stealth addresses cannot be determined without access to the underlying viewing key.

Before randomizing a user's canonical address <Latex>C</Latex>, it needs to be mapped to a pair of points <Latex>C→(G,C)</Latex>. We refer to this <Latex>(G,C)</Latex> pair as the "canonical stealth address" even though it's not really a "stealth address" because we haven't randomized it yet.

To randomize a stealth address pair <Latex>S=(H1​,H2​)</Latex>, we sample a random scalar <Latex> s←Fr​</Latex>and scalar-multiply into both curve elements, i.e. <Latex>S′=(s×H1​,s×H2​)</Latex>. Note that any user may randomize any stealth address without knowing the underlying viewing key or canonical address. All they need is a random number generator and an existing stealth address. We sometimes call this "re-randomization".

Given a user's viewing key <Latex>vk</Latex>, we say the <Latex>vk</Latex> "owns" a stealth address if the address was generated from <Latex>vk</Latex>. This is true if and only if the following equation holds true:
