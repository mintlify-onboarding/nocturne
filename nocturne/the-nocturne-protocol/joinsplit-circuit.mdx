## Encodings
For the purposes of this circuit, we define a few data structures and standard encodings to field elements.

## Asset Encoding
Firstly, we define an Asset by the following struct:

```c
struct Asset {
    // an enum representing the type of the asset
    AssetType assetType,
    // a 160-bit address
    address assetAddr,
    // the "ID" of the asset. This is only relevant for ERC721 and ERC1155
    uint256 assetId,
}

enum AssetType {
    // maps to integer value `0`
    ERC20,
    // maps to integer value `1`
    ERC721,
    // maps to integer value `2`
    ERC1155
}
```

To encode the asset, we transform it into the following form:
```c
struct EncodedAsset {
    // the asset address with the top-3 bits of `assetId`
    // and `assetType` packed into it
    uint256 encodedAssetAddr;
    // the bottom 253 bits of `assetId`
    uint256 encodedAssetId;
}
```
Both fields of `EncodedAsset` are guaranteed to be valid elements of Fp. We define the encoding for each as follows:

1. `encodedAssetId` is the number represented by the 253 least-significant bits of `assetId`.
2. `encodedAssetAddr` is defined as follows, from most-significant to least-significant:
- 3 `0` bits
- the 3 most-significant bits of `assetId`
- 88 bits that are left unspecified (currently they are ignored)
- 2 bits representing `assetType` - `00` for `ERC20`, `01` for `ERC721`, `10` for `ERC1155`.
- 160 bits representing `assetAddr`.

## Note Encoding
We define the Note and EncodedNote structs as follows:

```c
struct Note {
    // an anonymous stealth address for the note's owner
    SteatlhAddress owner;
    // a nonce that must be a valid element of the BN254 Scalar field
    uint256 nonce;
    // the asset the note is for
    Asset asset;
    // the amount of value in `asset` the note "holds"
    // this must be less than 2^252
    uint256 value;
}

struct StealthAddress {
  // the X coordinate of the first component of the stealth address
  uint256 h1X;
  // the Y coordinate of the first component of the stealth address
  uint256 h1Y;
  // the X coordinate of the second component of the stealth address
  uint256 h2X;
  // the Y coordinate of the second component of the stealth address
  uint256 h2Y
}

struct EncodedNote {
    // same as above
    StealthAddress owner;
    // same as above
    uint256 nonce;
    // pull out from EncodedAsset
    uint256 encodedAssetAddr;
    // pull out from EncodedAsset
    uint256 encodedAssetId;
    // same as above
    uint256 value;
}
```

_Within nocturne, all amounts and balances are forced to be 252-bit integers_. This ensures it's impossible to overflow the field.

The `StealthAddress` struct is a "flattened" form of a [stealth address](/nocturne/the-nocturne-protocol/keys-signatures-and-addresses##addresses). We recall that pair of Baby Jubjub curve elements  , and represent the  and  coordinates of both curve elements as struct fields.
The encoding process for a `Note` is to encode the `asset` and then pull out the `encodedAssetAddr` and `encodedAssetId` fields. 

Other specially-treated inputs

We define `opDigest` as a hash of an "operation" the JoinSplit is associated with. The hash is computed outside the circuit using Keccak and is reduced modulo p to an element of Fp. The circuit assumes that `opDigest` was independently computed by the verifier. 

For the purposes of a recipient being able to know the sender, we use ElGamal encryption in-circuit to encrypt the sender's canonical address. The ciphertext is of the form (C1, C2)∈G2

For efficiency, we only encrypt in the X coordinat of the sender's canonical address. Similarly, to save public inputs, we only include the X coordinate of C1 and C2. To recover the Y coordinate, the verifier can use the curve equation outside the circuit.

### Statement to Prove

The JoinSplit circuit has a total of 11 public inputs:

1. `commitmentTreeRoot` - the current [commitment tree root](/nocturne/the-nocturne-protocol/notes-nullifiers-and-joinsplits)
2. `encodedAssetAddr` - The the [encodedAssetAddr](/nocturne/the-nocturne-protocol/joinsplit-circuit#asset-encoding) field of the encoded asset being spent
3. `encodedAssetId` - The the [encodedAssetId](/nocturne/the-nocturne-protocol/joinsplit-circuit#asset-encoding) field of the encoded asset being spent
4. `opDigest` - The operation digest
5. `publicSpend` - The amount to unwrap publicly
6. `newNoteACommitment` - The note commitment for the first output note
7. `newNoteBCommitment` - The note commitment for the second output note
8. `nullifierA` - The nullifier for the first input note
9. `nullifierB` - The nullifier for the second input note
10. `encSenderCanonAddrC1X` - The x-coordinate of the first component of the ciphertext of the sender's canonical address
11. `encSenderCanonAddrC2X` - the x-coordinate of the second component of the ciphertext of the sender's canonical address

And requires the following private data:

1. `vk`: the [viewing key](/nocturne/the-nocturne-protocol/keys-signatures-and-addresses#key-derivation)
2. `vkNonce`: the[ nonce used in viewing key derivation](/nocturne/the-nocturne-protocol/keys-signatures-and-addresses#key-derivation)
3. `spendPK`: the [spending public key](/nocturne/the-nocturne-protocol/keys-signatures-and-addresses#key-derivation)
4. `(c, z)`: a [Schnorr signature](/nocturne/the-nocturne-protocol/joinsplit-circuit#asset-encoding) of `opDigest`
5. `oldNoteA`: an EncodedNote representing the first input note
6. `oldNoteB`: an EncodedNote representing the second input note
7. `newNoteA`: an EncodedNote representing the first output note
8. `newNoteB`: an EncodedNote representing the second output note
9. `MembershipProofA`: a Merkle membership proof for oldNoteA's [note commitment](/nocturne/the-nocturne-protocol/notes-nullifiers-and-joinsplits) in the commitment tree
10. `MembershipProofB`: a Merkle membership proof for oldNoteB's [note commitment]((/nocturne/the-nocturne-protocol/notes-nullifiers-and-joinsplits)) in the commitment tree
11. `receiverCanonAddr`: the canonical address of the receiver
12. senderCanonAddr: the canonical address of the receiver
13. encRandomness: a random nonce∈Frfor ElGamal

We prove that the following conditions hold true:

1. `vk` and `vkNonce` correctly correspond to `spendPk`
2. `senderCanonAddr` is indeed the canonical address corresponding to `vk`
3. the signature `(c, z)` is valid
4. `oldNoteA.owner` and `oldNoteB.owner` are well-formed [stealth addresses](/nocturne/the-nocturne-protocol/keys-signatures-and-addresses#addresses)
5. `oldNoteA.owner` and oldNoteB.owner are both [owned](/nocturne/the-nocturne-protocol/keys-signatures-and-addresses#addresses) by `vk`
6. `MembershipProofA.leaf` is the note commitment for `oldNoteA`
7. `MembershipProofB.leaf` is the note commitment for `oldNoteB`, or `oldNoteB.value = 0` (we don't care about `oldNoteB` if its value is `0`)
8. `MembershipProofA` is a valid Merkle membership proof against `commitmentTreeRoot`
9. `MembershipProofB` is a valid Merkle membership proof against `commitmentTreeRoot`, or `oldNoteB.value = 0` (we don't care about `oldNoteB` if its value is `0`)
10. `newNoteA.owner.H2 = senderCanonAddr` and `newNoteA.owner.H1 =`[G](/nocturne/the-nocturne-protocol/keys-signatures-and-addresses#algebraic-primitives) (i.e. `newNoteA.owner` is the sender's [canonical stealth address](/nocturne/the-nocturne-protocol/keys-signatures-and-addresses))
11. `newNoteB.owner.H2 = receiverCanonAddr` and `newNoteB.owner.H1 =`[G](/nocturne/the-nocturne-protocol/keys-signatures-and-addresses#algebraic-primitives) (i.e. `newNoteB.owner` is the receiver's [canonical stealth address](/nocturne/the-nocturne-protocol/keys-signatures-and-addresses))
12. `oldNoteA.value + oldNoteB.value = newNoteA.value + newNoteB.value + publicSpend`
13. `newNoteACommitment` is the note commitment for `newNoteA`
14. `newNoteBCommitment` is the note commitment for `newNoteB`
15. (`encSenderCanonAddrC1X, encSenderCanonAddrC2X`) is the ciphertext one would get after encrypting `senderCanonAddr` using ElGamal with nonce `encRandomness`.
