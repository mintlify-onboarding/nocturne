Just like ZCash Sapling, Nocturne performs all bookkeeping through a UTXO system of notes spent via an operation called a JoinSplit, and prevents double-spends via nullifiers. Before we dive further into the protocol, we must first understand these concepts.

**Notes**

A **_note_** can conceptually be thought of as a "dollar bill" with an owner. It takes the form of a record with three fields:

1. `owner`: an anonymous [stealth address](/nocturne/the-nocturne-protocol/notes-and-nullifiers-and-joinsplits) for the note's owner (we will cover these in the next section)
2. `asset`: a field indicating the asset the note is for. Currently, Nocturne has the capability to support ERC20 (fungible tokens), ERC721 (NFTs), and ERC1155 (semi-fungible tokens).
3. `value`: a number indicating how much of the asset this note is for.

A **_note commitment_** is a cryptographic hash of the note.

Notes can be acquired in one of three ways:

1. By depositing funds into the Nocturne contracts (i.e. "wrapping" them)
2. By receiving a "refund" containing all of the unspent assets left over at the end of an "operation"
3. By receiving a note through a JoinSplit (i.e. a "confidential payment")

On-chain, the Handler contract maintains a Merkle tree of the note commitments for all "valid" notes - that is, notes that were created during one of these three events. We refer to this tree as the **_commitment tree_**. In order to spend a note, one must prove that its note commitment is in the commitment tree.

**Nullifiers**

To spend a note, one needs the owner's [viewing key](/nocturne/the-nocturne-protocol/keys-and-stealth-addresses) and [spending key](/nocturne/the-nocturne-protocol/keys-and-stealth-addresses), the spending key is used to sign the transaction, and the viewing key is used to derive a secret number called a **_nullifier_**.

Every note has one nullifier, and every nullifier corresponds to one note. Nullifiers can only be derived using the owner's viewing key.

On-chain, the Handler contract keeps track of a set of nullifiers. Each time a note is spent, its nullifier is revealed and the contract will check if the revealed nullifier is in the set:

- If it's not in the set, the contract will accept the note, proceed with the transaction, and add the nullifier to the set.
- If it is in the set, then the contract will reject the note and revert.

Since each nullifier is uniquely tied to a note, this prevents double-spends.

**JoinSplits**

All Notes are spent via an operation called a **_JoinSplit_**. A **_JoinSplit_** is an operation through which two _input notes) are spent by revealing their nullifiers, and two output notes are created. The notes' owner must sign this operation with their [spending key](/nocturne/the-nocturne-protocol/keys-and-stealth-addresses). They can choose the owners and amounts of the output notes, subject to the following constraints:

1. The total value of the input notes equals the total value of the output notes plus an additionally-declared public spend amount, which may be 0.
2. The input notes and output notes all have the  same asset
3. Both notes' commitments are in the commitment tree

Only the following information is revealed on-chain:

- the asset to spend
- the public spend amount (can be 0)
- the nullifiers for both input notes
- the commitments for both output notes

By choosing the values/owners of the output notes, we can use a JoinSplit to perform a wide variety of tasks:
- We can "merge" together small notes by one of the output note values to 0 and the other to the total input value. Going with the "dollar bill" analogy, this is like combining 2 $1 bills into a single $2 bill.
- We can pay another user within the protocol without revealing the amount by setting the owner to another user's stealth address. We call this a "confidential payment"
- We can unwrap assets from within the pool for usage in an operation by setting the total output amount to be less than the total input amount and specifying a nonzero public spend amount.
- We can do a combination of the above - for instance, in a single JoinSplit, I can unwrap some ETH for a Uniswap transfer AND send a confidential ETH payment to a friend.
