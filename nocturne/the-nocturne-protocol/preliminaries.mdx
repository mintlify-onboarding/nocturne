Before we dive further into the protocol's implementation details, we must first have a more granular understanding of what the protocol is doing by introducing the following core concepts.

1. [Nocturne's anonymous addressing scheme](/nocturne/the-nocturne-protocol/preliminaries/keys-and-stealth-addresses), which involves separate keys for viewing transactions and signing transactions

2. [The primitives Nocturne uses for bookkeeping](/nocturne/the-nocturne-protocol/preliminaries/notes-nullifiers-and-joinsplits) \- Notes, Nullifiers, and JoinSplits
